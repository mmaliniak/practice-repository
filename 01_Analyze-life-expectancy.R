# This is a .R file, used for writing code in R
# Lines that begin with a "#" are comments, and can contain non-code sentences.

# library() is a function to load in a set of R functions contained in the library
# The tidyverse library loads many using packages into memory.
# The broom library contains functions to convert output into tidy tables
# If this is your first time loading these libraries, you will first need to install them.
# Do this using by un-commenting the `install.packages()` lines of code and executing them. 
# You only ever need to install an R package once (or when you re-install R).
# You need to re-load a library whenever you start a new R session.
